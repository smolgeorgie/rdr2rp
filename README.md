## **Introduction**

My name is Isabella McGraw. I’m twenty years old and I’ve lived most of my life on the move, hunting, farming, working with my hands, and surviving off the land. I was raised by my father with little to our name, but a whole lot of grit. We moved from place to place, never settling, always trying to find somewhere better. 

Now I’ve come to this county with one goal in mind, to build a life that’s stable. To root myself in the soil and grow something real. Starting a ranch has been a dream planted deep in my chest, and it’s time to bring it to life. I carry with me all the knowledge my daddy passed down, from raising animals, to tracking game, to fixing what’s broken, and getting creative when needed. The ranch would be more than a business, it would be a place where hard work, honesty, and community come together.

## **Why a Ranch?**

Growing up the way I did, I learned how to work the land, not because I had to, but because I loved it. There's peace in the rhythm of ranch life, waking up early, feeding livestock, growing crops, preparing goods, and helping those in need. I’ve got Norwegian roots and a strong back, and I don’t shy away from putting in the work.

Little Creek River is the perfect place to start this journey. It’s quiet, rich in nature, and has space to grow. My goal is to create a self-sufficient ranch that not only serves the town with fresh produce and quality goods, but also offers services that help the community thrive.

## **Little Creek Ranch: Goods & Services**

**Location:** Gallows Creek, by Little Creek River  
**Owner & Operator:** Isabella McGraw

---

### **Fresh Goods**
For the ranch, I want to produce all kinds of goods that come straight from the land and the animals we raise. The goal is to support the people of Commonhealth and surrounding areas with honest products and to work alongside other businesses that need supplies they can trust.

#### **Meats:**
- Cow  
- Goat  
- Chicken  
- Wild bird  

#### **Produce:**
- Eggs  
- Milk  
- Cheese  
- Cream  
- Feathers  
- Animal fat  
- Wool  
- Leather  

#### **Crops:**
- Corn & wheat  
- Herbs & vegetables  
- Fruit preserves & dried goods

### **Services**

#### **Courier Service**
A reliable delivery of goods across the county and handled with care. I want to work with other businesses that can't take that workload and need help, but also the residents of commonwealth whenever they need help with transport of any kind. 

#### **Ranch Hands for Hire**
I want to provide help with farm works, where-ever is needed. This service is meant for folks who might be short on help, passing through with a job that needs extra muscle, or looking for someone with experience in ranch life. We’re happy to lend a hand for a day, a week, or just a quick task.

#### **Lodging**
Simple lodging available for travelers, traders, and those looking to rest by the river.

For this, I have created a poster that will demonstrate what it will look like in the newspaper. It got a map on the left that will tell the location, logo on the right and our products on the bottom.

## **Staff & Work Culture**

Little Creek Ranch is not a one-person job. I plan to employ **1 to 10 employees** who each have their own role, from livestock care and crop tending, to courier work and product crafting. I believe in teamwork with freedom. Ranch hands are trusted to manage their own tasks and are **free to roam and take on other work**, as long as they communicate it with me. That way, everyone grows, the ranch and the people in it.

## **Budget & Investment Plan**

To start the ranch properly, with livestock, tools, seeds, and basic housing, I will take out a **loan of $20,000**. I understand the responsibility this carries, and I’m committed to **paying it off quickly through consistent hard work, trade, and service.**

**Estimated Expenses:**
- Land lease or ownership  
- Livestock & feed  
- Farming tools 
- Supplies for courier and food processing  
- Staff payment

## **Closing Words**

Little Creek Ranch isn’t just a business, it’s a fresh start. I’m here to build something that lasts, to work hard, help others, and make this place a part of the community.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I’m ready to get to work.
  
**Sincerely,**  
**Isabella McGraw**
